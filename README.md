The Hypothesis
--------------
> The proportion of tweets written in a specific language will vary over time, and will do so in a predictable manner. For example, at noon EST we would expect to see a large number of tweets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese as the Americas are awake. 12 hours later we’d see more written in Japanese, Thai, and Cantonese. Therefore, given access to enough historical data, it should be possible to sample the live tweet stream and estimate the current time, and potentially even the day of the week, with some reasonable degree of accuracy.

Thus is born the most ridiculous clock ever – WhatTimeIsTwit?

The Project
-----------
Not ready for primetime yet :) But there are some interesting bits of code for classifying text into (human) languages
